## Detailed Explanation

### HTML
- Uses semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and structure.
- Includes a `hero` section with an attention-grabbing design.
- FAQ accordion uses `<button>` and `aria-expanded` attributes for better accessibility.

### CSS
- Responsive design is achieved through media queries for different screen sizes.
- Dark-themed, modern design using the Poppins font.
- Animations for FAQ transitions are implemented using `max-height` and `ease-in-out`.

### JavaScript
- Manages the FAQ accordion functionality by toggling classes and dynamically adjusting the `max-height` property.
- Implements click event listeners for interactivity.
